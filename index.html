        <p class="summery">The new site will be built based on the previous site. It will become a more delicate and compelete portfolio site with a richer content being displayed. It will include not only my garment collections, but also the pictures I took as inspirations for my current and further work. I may also include some progress pictures showing how I develop my garment design. For the detailed enhancements and directions, click on the "Enhancements" and "Examples" to see more.  </p>
